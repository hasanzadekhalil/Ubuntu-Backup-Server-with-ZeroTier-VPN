# Ubuntu Backup Server with ZeroTier VPN
This project shows how to set up backup server on Raspberry Pi and similar devices and how to create a connection between these computers that are not on the same network with the help of ZeroTierVPN.

After that, the client computer directly communicates with the server with the help of VPN without having to be on the same network and performs the backup process.
